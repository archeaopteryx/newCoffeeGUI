# newCoffeeGUI
GUI to track balances for a group of users sharing a coffee machine

goal was to have minimal dependencies. Application uses tkinter. Intended to be used on a system that only has a monitor and mouse.

Program crashes hard on MacOS. Cause is likely beyond my abilities to fix. Program will directly exit with a message printed to console if run on macOS.
