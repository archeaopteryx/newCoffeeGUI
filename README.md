# newCoffeeGUI
GUI to track balances for a group of users sharing a coffee machine

goal was to write a bare-bones application and have minimal dependencies. Application uses tkinter. Intended to be used on a system that only has a monitor and mouse, so all data input done through clickable interfaces.

Program crashes hard on MacOS, likely due to support issue for tkinter. Program will directly exit with a message printed to console if run on macOS.
